# IMDB Movie Recommender

## Description
A content-based movie recommendation system built using Python. The app suggests similar movies based on plot descriptions from the IMDB Top 1000 dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## How It Works
- Interactive Streamlit interface for user input
- Displays movie data (title, release year, IMDB rating, actors, director, short overview) and lets user filter by minimum rating, genre, and year 
- Enhanced features: visualization of Bar chart/Histogram of IMDB ratings of recommended movies and Popularity bias (combine similarity + popularity) and also a random movie recommender (surprise the user)

## What I Learned
- Working with real-world datasets
- Building recommendation systems
- Creating data apps with Streamlit
